This means that our traces could have been read by someone else. In our implementation, before sending the traces to Rollbar we strip any personal information that might be present or any access token to DatoCMS projects.\n\nApart from the posted data in the traces nothing else could have been exposed to third parties.\n\nIn any case, on Sep 12th we have rotated all our tokens and deleted all the stack traces that were present in Rollbar. To this day we don't have any evidence that any of our data was accessed by a malicious third party."
