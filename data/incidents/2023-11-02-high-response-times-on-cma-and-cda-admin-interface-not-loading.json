This means that requests sent to those endpoints (site-api.datocms.com, graphql.datocms.com) started to have high latencies or timeout errors (503). \n\nThe admin interface was affected too, since it uses the CMA endpoint itself.\n\nThe cause was as unusual amount of traffic that we are going to investigate further.\n\nWe are monitoring the situation right now."

This caused generic slow downs as the requests were authenticated as users and were hitting directly our web servers.\n\nTo avoid this from happening again we have added rate-limitations to JWT tokens, that are used by plugins acting as users, something that we didn't anticipate before.",
