This caused the API to fail until we identified and rolled back the changes.\n\nPrevention\n\nWe're implementing stricter code review checks to ensure migration-only deployments don't include dependent code, and adding automated tests to catch this type of issue before deployment.\n\nWe apologise for the disruption and appreciate your patience.",
