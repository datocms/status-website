We use auto SSL (a Lua plugin for Nginx) to issue certificates for new custom CMS addresses (like datocms.yourdomain.com). At the beginning of the issue a new site has been created with a custom domain that wasn't properly configured. This caused auto SSL to fail and try different connections using IPv6, which wasn't configured on the server. This caused Nginx to stop responding even if the service was up. So on server restart everything worked as expected.\n\nWe have now added an IPv6 address to the machine to prevent this from happening again.\n\nAlso our status page is showing the downtime of the issue and we are putting in place systems to handle these type of events in a quicker manner.",
