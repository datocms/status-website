The conseguence is that you might have noticed that the daily reports showed bigger numbers each day.\n\nThese reports includes data such as:\n\n- Top assets by traffic\n- Top API tokens for CDA\n\nand they are **not** related to usage data we use to bill extra plan usages.\n\nToday, we have fixed the origin problem and we have reset the daily reports. All existing data have been saved in the \"Current Month\" report, so no data has been lost.\n\nSorry for any problems this might have caused to you."
