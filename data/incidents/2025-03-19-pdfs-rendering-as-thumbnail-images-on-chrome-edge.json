Firefox and Safari are not affected.\n\nThis is a bug on our end and we are trying to resolve it ASAP. Very sorry about this.\n\nA current workaround is to append `?skip-default-optimizations` to the end of the URL, like:\nhttps://www.datocms-assets.com/123456/123456789-your-file.pdf?skip-default-optimizations\n\nThat should allow the PDF to load normally.\n\nWe are working on a permanent resolution and will update here as soon as we can.\n",
